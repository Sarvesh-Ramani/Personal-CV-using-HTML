                        I am a final year student in Mechanical Engineering in CIT Coimbatore. A few years from now, I look forward to pursuing 
                        my dream as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics">Astrophysicist</a> in top facilities in the world. 
                        I have wide interests and have explored various domains like 
                        <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-ethical-hacking.html">Ethical Hacking</a>,

                        AI and ML</a> through online courses, youtube tutorials, blogs, and working on various projects to actively put those 
                        skills into practice and always looking forward to learning something new. I am an active learner and developer to up-skill 
                        myself as and when possible. Currently I have joined AppViewX as a SDE-2.
